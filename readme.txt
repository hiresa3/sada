Offers may end without notice and are subject to separate terms.<\/p> <p>If you have an existing subscription to the Disney Bundle, Disney+, and/or ESPN+ that are billed directly by Disney or ESPN+, as applicable, your existing subscription(s) will be paused after you register your Disney Bundle perk with Disney+. If you cancel Disney Bundle through Verizon, your previous subscription(s) billed directly by Disney will resume.<\/p> <p>If you have an existing Hulu (With Ads), Hulu (No Ads), Hulu + Live TV, Hulu (No Ads) + Live TV, or Disney Bundle subscription, and are billed by Hulu, the Disney Bundle perk may not automatically replace that subscription. After successfully enrolling and completing account setup of all three streaming services that are part of the Disney Bundle perk, existing Hulu (With Ads) and Hulu (No Ads) subscribers billed directly by Hulu will see a credit from Hulu on their billing statement for an amount equal to the then-current retail price of Hulu (With Ads), for as long as they maintain an eligible subscription through Verizon. Unless otherwise directed, note that in order to receive any credit, existing subscribers must complete Hulu account setup through the link provided by Disney+. Note that existing Hulu (With Ads) and Hulu (No Ads) subscribers billed directly by Hulu may need to manage add-ons in order to complete Hulu account setup. Subscribers to one of Hulu&rsquo;s Live TV plans or the Disney Bundle billed directly by Hulu will need to cancel or switch their base plan to the Hulu (With Ads) or Hulu (No Ads) plan in order to complete Hulu account setup. Annual Hulu subscribers will need to cancel their Hulu subscription in order to complete Hulu account setup; cancellation will forfeit the remainder of the annual subscription period and will not be entitled to a refund. If you currently have a Hulu subscription billed through a third party, you will need to manage your account and wait until the end of your billing period in order to complete Hulu account setup; you will continue to be billed for your existing Hulu subscription until you manage your account. If you do not have an existing Hulu subscription at the time you enroll in the Disney Bundle plan perk, you will not be able to switch your plan or purchase add-ons offered by Hulu while enrolled.<\/p> <p>For any existing Hulu subscriber, no refunds will be provided for subscription fees already paid to Hulu.<\/p> <p>If your subscription to the Disney Bundle, Disney+, and/or ESPN+ is through a third party like Apple, Google, Amazon, Roku or others, the Disney Bundle perk will not automatically replace or pause that subscription. After you enroll and complete account setup, you will be sent an email with information about how to manage your existing subscription. You will continue to be billed for your existing subscription through the third party until you follow the instructions in the email.<\/p> <p>To ensure that your existing subscription(s) are paused or credited, or that you receive a notification to manage your existing subscription(s), in each case as applicable pursuant to these terms and conditions, you must use the same email when registering your Disney Bundle plan perk subscription that you used to purchase your existing subscription(s). You should review your terms and conditions from any previous providers regarding any obligations, subscription management or cancellation.<\/p> <p>You can cancel Disney Bundle at any time through My Verizon Online or the My Verizon App. Offer may end without notice.<\/p> <p>Use of the Disney+ service is subject to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.disneyplus.com/legal/subscriber-agreement'>Disney+ and ESPN+ Subscriber Agreement<\/a>.
